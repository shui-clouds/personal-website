# 👩🏻‍💻 My Personal Website (WIP)

## 👩‍💻 Getting Started with development
Have an up to date version of Node.js 14+ installed

Clone the repository

Open VSCode (optional) in this directory

## Commands
There are some useful commands (found inside package.json) that you can run to help you with development.

### `npm run dev`

Starts a development server. There is hot-reloading (changes apply without refresh) so you can easily view and test the app during dev.

### `npm run build`
Creates a production-ready, optimized build of the website. Once the app is built, you can use npm run start (see below) to use it.

### `npm run start`
Starts the production server. Please make sure to run npm run build first to build the latest version of the app before starting the prod server.

### `npm run lint`
Runs the linter (ESLint) on all of the website code. This will check for any warnings or critical lint suggestions.
